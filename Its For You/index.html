            <div class="text-line">So, BHAAVYA DAS, lemme put it straight,</div>
            <div class="text-line">damn who am I kidding, I can't put it straight</div>
            <div class="text-line">but I want to say that in everybody's life there is one person jiske sath time flies,</div>
            <div class="text-line">the person jiske sath you feel valuable,</div>
            <div class="text-line">the person jiske liye you pray "Please don't separate our ways ever",</div>

            <div class="text-line">On that day I saw that me, a mere failure...</div>
            <div class="text-line">a stupid guy, a senseless person can also have a life</div>
            <div class="text-line">and specially when that life is shown to him by a person close to his heart.</div>
            <div class="text-line">I never saw the sensible future with any girl that I see with you</div>
            <div class="text-line">...you know why?</div>
            <div class="text-line">Because when we talk, I see how perfectly you fit in every part of my life.</div>
            <div class="text-line">I can see you happy with my family</div>
            <div class="text-line">I can see you travelling with me,</div>
            <div class="text-line">singing songs sitting in our lawn</div>
            <div class="text-line">I mean I never felt this way with anyone.</div>
            <div class="text-line">Life teaches you ki when to be with someone, you should be able to look at her and commit yourself.</div>
            <div class="text-line">and with my 20 years, I want to share every second of that time being with you.</div>
            <div class="text-line">Whenever I open Instagram, and your story appears</div>
            <div class="text-line">mann that broad smile I can't tell you</div>
            <div class="text-line">that every reel I see and want to tag you...</div>
            <div class="text-line">then I overthink for 30 mins and decide not to lol.</div>
            <div class="text-line">Even if I talk to you for 5 mins na...</div>
            <div class="text-line">it's like I can feel my heart</div>
            <div class="text-line">That adrenaline rush when I see you ki Bro, don't let her feel uncomfortable</div>
            <div class="text-line">don't say anything jisse vo hurt ho jaye</div>
            <div class="text-line">and then as I said...time flies.</div>                       
            <div class="text-line">I know you had a date recently and its okay if you don't feel the same way back, I understand...but</div>
            <div class="text-line">Do you want to sit and see a sunset together?</div>
            <div class="text-line">If yes, I'll be waiting for you at frisco at 8:30 with a brownie :)</div>
